- automated copy-photos-to-harddrive 'thinggy'




To install this 'package' copy the files to their respective locations as shown below.

91-cardcopy.rules  	--> /etc/udev/rules.d/
cardcopy		--> /usr/local/bin
cardcopy@.service	--> /etc/systemd/system/

Then alter the cardcopy script to your liking......

Also run 'systemctl daemon-reload' and 'udevadm control --reload' to make sure
the system picks up your changes.

Then feel free to insert any 'sdb1' or 'sdc1' device (or change the .rules file to match what you want......) and all the pictures will be copied 
(you can change to move if you want 'auto-card-cleaning')
to the location as specified in 'cardcopy' script




Enjoy!
